<p>This afternoon, while listening to “All Things Considered” on Wisconsin Public Radio, I heard an excerpt from John Roberts’s recent commencement address. Here is <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/03/535408617/chief-justice-john-roberts-bucks-tradition-in-graduation-speech">the story from “All Things Considered”</a>. Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/Gzu9S5FL-Ug?t=5m45s">YouTube video</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts spoke at his son’s 9th grade graduation from <a href="https://www.cardigan.org/Home/Home">The Cardigan Mountain School</a>, a boarding school for boys in grades 6 to 9, on June 3, 2017.</p>
