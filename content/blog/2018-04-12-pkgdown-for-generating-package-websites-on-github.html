<p>I recently learned about the R package, <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown"><code>pkgdown</code></a>, an R package that provides functions that make it easy to build a website from an R package on Github.</p>
<p>I decided to build a site for my package <code>qtl2pleio</code>. The site is <a href="https://fboehm.github.io/qtl2pleio/index.html">here</a>. It features a documentation page for each function in the package.</p>
<p>Using <code>pkgdown</code> is extremely easy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;r-lib/pkgdown&quot;)
library(pkgdown)
build_site()</code></pre>
<p><code>pkgdown</code> is used by more than 1300 packages, according to its README file.</p>
