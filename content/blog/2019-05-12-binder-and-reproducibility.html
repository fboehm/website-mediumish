<p><a href="https://kbroman.org/">Karl Broman</a> recently discussed the Binder project on <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2019/02/18/omg_binder/">his blog</a>, so I thought that I would try to use it for my new R package <a href="https://fboehm.us/static/software/qtl2pleio/"><code>qtl2pleio</code></a>, which I have shared on <a href="https://github.com/fboehm/qtl2pleio/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>As a R package developer, I like Binder because it allows a prospective user to explore my code (and the entire package) without requiring them to download it. Binder opens an interactive Rstudio session in “the cloud” to allow a user to run code online.</p>

<h2>Binder setup</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Binder documentation</a> lists several ways to set up Binder to work with a git repo with R code. I focus, in particular, on a git repo that is a proper R package that is publicly accessible on Github. My package <a href="https://github.com/fboehm/qtl2pleio/"><code>qtl2pleio</code></a> is the motivating example.</p>
<p>The three methods for integrating Binder with a R project, to the best of my knowledge, all involve creation of additional files that reside in your R package on Github.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>install.R</code> and <code>runtime.txt</code></li>
<li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> and <code>runtime.txt</code></li>
<li><code>Dockerfile</code></li>
</ol>
<p>From what I can tell, the three methods differ in the time needed for setup when a user launches a new session in the cloud. It seems that the last method is the fastest when no new commits have been pushed to the git repository on Github.</p>
<p>The simplicity of merely adding a <code>runtime.txt</code> file to an existing R package repository makes the second option appealing.</p>
