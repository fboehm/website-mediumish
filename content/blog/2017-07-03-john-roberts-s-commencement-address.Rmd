This afternoon, while listening to "All Things Considered" on Wisconsin Public Radio, I heard an excerpt from John Roberts's recent commencement address. Here is [the story from "All Things Considered"](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/03/535408617/chief-justice-john-roberts-bucks-tradition-in-graduation-speech). Here is the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Gzu9S5FL-Ug?t=5m45s).


Roberts spoke at his son's 9th grade graduation from [The Cardigan Mountain School](https://www.cardigan.org/Home/Home), a boarding school for boys in grades 6 to 9, on June 3, 2017.
