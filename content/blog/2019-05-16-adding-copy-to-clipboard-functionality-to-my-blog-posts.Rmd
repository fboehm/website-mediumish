I use the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to build my blog, but I really like the way that the R package [`pkgdown`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) formats R code. In particular, it uses a javascript library, [`clipboard.js`](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js) to facilitate copying of R code from "articles" (i.e., rendered vignettes from an R package) to the user's clipboard. I wanted to see if I could use clipboard.js to add this feature to my blog posts. 

I created a plain text file that contains html code that specifies the use of clipboard.js, sticky-kit.js, and the pkgdown js and css files.

```{r}
library(blogdown)
```
