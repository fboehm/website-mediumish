[Karl Broman](https://kbroman.org/) recently discussed the Binder project on [his blog](https://kbroman.org/blog/2019/02/18/omg_binder/), so I thought that I would try to use it for my new R package [`qtl2pleio`](https://fboehm.us/static/software/qtl2pleio/), which I have shared on [Github](https://github.com/fboehm/qtl2pleio/). 

As a R package developer, I like Binder because it allows a prospective user to explore my code (and the entire package) without requiring them to download it. Binder opens an interactive Rstudio session in "the cloud" to allow a user to run code online.



## Binder setup

The [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lists several ways to set up Binder to work with a git repo with R code. I focus, in particular, on a git repo that is a proper R package that is publicly accessible on Github. My package [`qtl2pleio`](https://github.com/fboehm/qtl2pleio/) is the motivating example. 

The three methods for integrating Binder with a R project, to the best of my knowledge, all involve creation of additional files that reside in your R package on Github.

1. `install.R` and `runtime.txt`
1. `DESCRIPTION` and `runtime.txt`
1. `Dockerfile` 

From what I can tell, the three methods differ in the time needed for setup when a user launches a new session in the cloud. It seems that the last method is the fastest when no new commits have been pushed to the git repository on Github.

The simplicity of merely adding a `runtime.txt` file to an existing R package repository makes the second option appealing.
