[Karl Broman](https://kbroman.org/) recently discussed the Binder project on [his blog](https://kbroman.org/blog/2019/02/18/omg_binder/), so I thought that I would try to use it for my new R package [`qtl2pleio`](https://fboehm.us/static/software/qtl2pleio/), which I have shared on [Github](https://github.com/fboehm/qtl2pleio/). 

As a R package developer, I like Binder because it allows a prospective user to explore my code without requiring them to download it.
