## Motivation 

My colleague Rene Welch brought to my attention a recent pre-print, "LiMMBo: a simple, scalable approach for linear mixed models in high-dimensional genetic association studies" by Hannah Meyer, Francesco Casale, Oliver Stegle, and Ewan Birney. The biorxiv preprint is at [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/30/255497](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/30/255497)

The authors present a bootstrap-based strategy for fitting multivariate linear mixed effects models in genetics studies with up to hundreds of phenotypes. They use the model:

$$vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E)$$ where G and E are independent n by p matrices of random effects and random errors, respectively; X is a $np$ by $p(f + c)$ block-diagonal matrix (with p blocks of dimension $n$ by $f + c$ on the diagonal) containing both the genetic marker data and the covariate values; B is a $f + c$ by $p$ matrix of covariate and allele effects. They also assume that G and E are matrix-variate normally distributed:

$$G \sim MN(0, K, V_g)$$ 

$$E \sim MN(0, I_n, V_e)$$

They use the bootstrap in a clever way in finding an estimate for the $np$ by $np$ covariance matrix. A single bootstrap sample of $s$ phenotypes is randomly drawn from the $p$ phenotypes for all subjects. They then estimate the marginal covariance matrix - and the matrices $V_g$ and $V_e$ - for the $s$-variate phenotype and repeat $b$ times. They then have $b$ estimates of marginal covariance matrices. By the nature of the sampling procedure, there may be multiple bootstrap samples in which traits $i$ and $j$ (for $1 \le i, j \le p$) both appear. They average each covariate trait pair $i$, $j$, then use least-squares to find the closest covariance matrix. The last step makes use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. 

I'm particularly interested in the methodology of this paper for reasons that I'll develop in a future blog post. For now, I want to document my initial attempts at using the R package `reticulate` 

## `reticulate` R package

The goal of `reticulate` R package, as I understand it, is to enable calling of `python` code from `R` and vice-versa.

The authors share freely their [`python` module `limmbo`](https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/limmbo) and [their analysis code](https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/LiMMBoAnalysis) on Github.

Recognizing that the methods would be useful in my research, and not wanting to work in `python`, I sought a way to use the existing `python` code within `R` code wrappers that I would write. An internet search guided me to the `reticulate` R package, which is on both CRAN and Github. 

## Initial R code with `reticulate`

I first installed Anaconda2 and `limmbo` as described by Hannah Meyer in the [`limmbo` README file](https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/limmbo/blob/77a148e0acde3bc26a6f6c17f52105054851d451/README.md). I then loaded the `reticulate` package in a new R session.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Within `reticulate`, there is a function `import` to load a `python` module (ie, like a *package* in the `R` terminology). But you want to be sure to store the output as something (don't just run `import()` without assigning its output to something).

```{r}
import("limmbo", convert = TRUE) -> limmbo
```

Now, we can look at the object `limmbo` & its contents. Typing merely `limmbo` at the R prompt isn't terribly helpful:

```{r}
limmbo
```


However, we can use the `$` operator to explore the contents of `limmbo`. 

```{r}
limmbo$core$vdsimple$vd_reml
```
It would be nice to know a little about this function. Let's look at its help page. To do that, we use the `reticulate` R package's function `py_help`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
py_help(limmbo$core$vdsimple$vd_reml)
```

If you're working in Rstudio in an interactive session, the `Python` help file will pop up in a new tab. The help file has 3 main sections: 1. Arguments, 2. Returns, and 3. Examples.

I'll work through the `python` code in the Examples section of the help file for the above function.

```{python}
import numpy
from numpy.random import RandomState
from numpy.linalg import cholesky as chol
from limmbo.core.vdsimple import vd_reml
from limmbo.io.input import InputData
random = RandomState(15)
N = 100
S = 1000
P = 3
snps = (random.rand(N, S) < 0.2).astype(float)
kinship = numpy.dot(snps, snps.T) / float(10)
y  = random.randn(N, P)
pheno = numpy.dot(chol(kinship), y)
pheno_ID = [ 'PID{}'.format(x+1) for x in range(P)]
samples = [ 'SID{}'.format(x+1) for x in range(N)]
datainput = InputData()
datainput.addPhenotypes(phenotypes = pheno,
phenotype_ID = pheno_ID, pheno_samples = samples)
datainput.addRelatedness(relatedness = kinship,
relatedness_samples = samples)
Cg, Cn, ptime = vd_reml(datainput, verbose=True)
print(Cg)
```

Now, we see that we created the objects `Cn`, `Cg` and `ptime` using `python`. We can access them with R code by using the object `py`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
py$Cg
py$Cn
py$ptime
```

## Examine `vdbootstrap` code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
(limmbo$core$vdbootstrap$LiMMBo(py$datainput, timing = TRUE, iterations = 100, S = 2) -> foo)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
limmbo$core$vdbootstrap$LiMMBo$runBootstrapCovarianceEstimation(foo, cpus = 1, seed = 12345, minCooccurrence = 10)
```

Rstudio has a `reticulate` site: https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html

They include many examples and discussions of more technical issues.
