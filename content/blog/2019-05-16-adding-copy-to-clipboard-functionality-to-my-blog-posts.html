<p>I use the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> to build my blog, but I really like the way that the R package <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown"><code>pkgdown</code></a> formats R code. In particular, it uses a javascript library, <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js"><code>clipboard.js</code></a> to facilitate copying of R code from “articles” (i.e., rendered vignettes from an R package) to the user’s clipboard. I wanted to see if I could use clipboard.js to add this feature to my blog posts.</p>
<p>I created a plain text file that contains html code that specifies the use of clipboard.js, sticky-kit.js, and the pkgdown js and css files.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(blogdown)</code></pre>
