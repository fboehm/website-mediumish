<p>While browsing the internet, I stumbled upon Rstudio’s new package <code>blogdown</code>. I read <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/">posts from Karl Broman</a> and found the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">the book</a> that the package author - Yihui Xie - freely shares.</p>
<p>One tricky part of setting up the website involved the DNS settings. I bought the site <code>fboehm.us</code> through google domains. While the blogdown book provides instructions for DNS settings for other domain name providers, at the time I set up my site, they hadn’t written instructions for use with google domains. Fortunately, it was not too difficult, and, through trial and error, I managed to succeed.</p>
<p>Under “Configure DNS” button on Google Domains, I chose “Use custom name servers”. Clicking on “Edit” enabled me to enter the server names that end in “nsone.net”.</p>
<p>In my netlify account page, under “Settings”, I edited “DNS Records” by creating a new record for CNAME. I entered host name: <code>www.fboehm.us</code> and target: <code>fboehm.us</code>. I hope that I set it up properly.</p>
