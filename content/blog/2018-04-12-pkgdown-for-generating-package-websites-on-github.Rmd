I recently learned about the R package, [`pkgdown`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown), an R package that provides functions that make it easy to build a website from an R package on Github.

I decided to build a site for my package `qtl2pleio`. The site is [here](https://fboehm.github.io/qtl2pleio/index.html). It features a documentation page for each function in the package. 

Using `pkgdown` is extremely easy.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/pkgdown")
library(pkgdown)
build_site()
```

`pkgdown` is used by more than 1300 packages, according to its README file.
